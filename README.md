# IoT
A9G is a complete quad-band GSM/GPRS+GPS module based on the RDA8955 chip. The cost reduction of the core chip provides users with a cost-effective IoT solution,  This module is a native board that can be programmed with Arduino Uno or by using USB to TTL UART.  Restrictions apply to this RF Equipment for use in Australia:  Only to be operated on 433Mhz / 915-930Mhz / 2.4Ghz  (check the product description for compatible frequency ranges). If operating outside of shared frequencies or in such a way that is beyond low interference potential devices are intended to function, then you are licensed to do so. For use in other locations around the world:  Follow region-specific frequency spectrum rules.
